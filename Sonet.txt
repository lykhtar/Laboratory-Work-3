Love is too young to know what conscience is,Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.For, thou betraying me, I do betrayMy nobler part to my gross body’s treason:My soul doth tell my body that he mayTriumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason;But rising at thy name doth point out theeAs his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,He is contented thy poor drudge to be,To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.No want of conscience hold it that I callHer ‘love’ for whose dear love I rise and fall. 
Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,When I against my self with thee partake?Do I not think on thee when I forgotAm of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,On whom frown’st thou that I do fawn upon,Nay if thou lour’st on me do I not spendRevenge upon my self with present moan?What merit do I in my self respect,That is so proud thy service to despise,When all my best doth worship thy defect,Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?But love hate on for now I know thy mind,Those that can see thou lov’st, and I am blind.
When I do count the clock that tells the time,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,When I behold the violet past prime,And sable curls all silvered o’er with white:When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,Which erst from heat did canopy the herdAnd summer’s green all girded up in sheavesBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard:Then of thy beauty do I question makeThat thou among the wastes of time must go,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,And die as fast as they see others grow,And nothing ‘gainst Time’s scythe can make defenceSave breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence
For shame deny that thou bear’st love to anyWho for thy self art so unprovident.Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,But that thou none lov’st is most evident:For thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate,That ‘gainst thy self thou stick’st not to conspire,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinateWhich to repair should be thy chief desire:O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,Make thee another self for love of me,That beauty still may live in thine or thee
Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,By unions married do offend thine ear,They do but sweetly chide thee, who confoundsIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:Mark how one string sweet husband to another,Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove none’
